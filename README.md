# Kotlin Things

## This is not a project, but a directory

For some time now, I really needed to learn `Kotlin` but it never happened.

So, in this new year I am really determined to learn `Kotlin` as much as I can building things with it
and this space will be used share the repository links for anything I might build with `Kotlin`.

Peace..!!

My primary source of learning will be [kotlinlang.org](https://kotlinlang.org/])

### Setting up Kotlin
I use a Windows PC :cry: <br>
Anyway, the easiest way to download and install `IntelliJ IDEA` IDE.<br>
Why? because `Kotlin` was developed by the folks at `Jetbrains` and their flagship IDE has Kotlin bundled with it.<br>
Or else, you would have to manually setup kotlin-compiler binaries.
